title: Skating Switch Is Hard As Shit
---

I skated a **lot** when I was younger. I spent about 6-7 years where every all
my spare time was spent skating the local park, a random school, some street
spots, or even just on my back verandah. Suffice to say, I was *very*
comfortable on a skateboard.

Now, at the age of 33, I've decided that I was gonna pick it up again. It didn't
take long to get comfortable on the board again - maybe half an hour or so
before I was cool with pushing, rolling, kickturns, flat banks, and mellow
transitions.

I've finally gotten a few simple tricks pretty dialed in, I figured it was time
to start getting used to skating switch (something I avoided at all costs when I
was younger), and all I can say so far is "holy shit, switch is hard as shit."

I've been spending 10-15 minutes evey time I go for a skate trying to just get
used to rolling switch and it's been all but impossible. I can barely balance
well enough to push, I can't turn, even just rolling straight on a basketball
court is super hard.

And yet, as soon as I shift my feet forward a few inches to riding fakie, I'm
way more comfortable. It's very weird.

It's given me a new found respect for all the people on
[/r/newskaters][newskaters] who are struggling to feel confident to go out in
public to skate when they are struggling to roll around. It's not something I
ever struggled with before, so I never truly appreciated how hard it can be.
