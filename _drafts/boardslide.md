Apparently this is a skateboarding blog now. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

I was back home at my parents place over the weekend just gone. It was good. I
got to see everyone, go out for dinner and get in a skate at the local park
there.

Overall, I probably prefer the parks up here in Brisbane, but there was a nifty
little rail that went down a flatbank that none of the parks I've skated so far
have had.

I've always loved boardslides down rails. They've always just seemed to be a
perfect expression of what skateboarding is to me: speed, height, balance,
finesse, and a fair dose of danger.

Since I've been back on a board, I've been working hard on getting my boardslides
dialed in. I was at a point where if I found a down rail at a decent enough height, I
could probably give it a shot.

This was my chance, and I took it. After a few sighters, I propped my phone up
on my t-shirt and went at it. In the end, it only took three tries to get a nice
smooth landing. I ended up trying (and landing) it a bunch more, but I never got
a landing as smooth as that first one.
