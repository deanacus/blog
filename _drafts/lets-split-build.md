title: Let's Split Build Log
---

Ever since I got my first mechanical keyboard back in 2015, I've been interested
in the possibility of building my own keyboard from scratch. I haven't quite
gotten to the point where I'm ready to design my own PCB[^1], but I am
ready to use someone else's PCB design to put together a keyboard from parts.

[^1]: Although that is definitely coming.
