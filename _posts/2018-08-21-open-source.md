title: Open Source Pays My Bills
---

That's a bit of an absurd statement for someone who doesn't really make many
contributions to open source to make. But I stand by it. 

I saw a question on Reddit earlier on today that asked "[What paid software does
a front-end developer need?][reddit]", which got me thinking:

> What paid software do I actually use?

And the answer is very little. But more surprising to me was that the vast
majority of the tools I use to earn a living are Free and open source.

At any given point in time, I can take a look at the source code for:

* My text editor ([VSCode][code])
* My terminal emulator ([Hyper][hyper])
* My build tools ([Webpack][webpack], [Babel][babel])
* The runtime for my build tools ([Node][node])
* My version control system ([Git][git])

And that's not even counting the fact that open source practically powers the
web.

Without open source software, I probably wouldn't have gotten started in this
industry, and I wouldn't be able to pay my bills doing something I so greatly
enjoy.

Support your friendly neighbourhood open source developer, folks. Without them,
the web would be a *very* different place.
