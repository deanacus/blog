title: I Quit. Again
---

Once upon a time, I was a smoker. A very heavy smoker. Then I quit. Yay me.

But then some time later, I took it up again. Boo me.

So, the time has come again to quit.

Smoking is *really* fucking stupid.

There are literally no positives that come from smoking. There are, however, shit-tonnes of negatives:

* You stink
* It's fucking expensive
* It fucks your lungs
* You've gotta go outside into the cold in the middle of winter/heat in the middle of summer
* You need to remember them everywhere you go

So, as of now, I'm a non-smoker again.
