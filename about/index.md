## My name is Dean Harris.

### I'm a front end developer, and skateboarder in Brisbane, QLD

I've been building shit for the web in some form for the last 10 or so years, though thankfully most of it has been lost to the mists of time.

Originally from the small town of [Lismore][lismore], I live in [Brisbane][brisbane] with my beautiful wife, Rachel, and our two mini daschunds, Evie and Snickers. In my free time, I can usually be found either drinking coffee and walking the dogs or skating at one of Brisbane's many skateparks.

This site is built with [Jekyll](jekyll), hosted for free at [Surge](surge). The [source][repo] is available to browse on [GitHub][github]

Check out the [gear][gear] page to see what I use to do the things I do.
