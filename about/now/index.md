## What I'm Doing Now

* Slowly learning and getting comfortable using Vim
* Teaching myself some of the new parts of ES2015 (promises, async/await, etc)
* Trying to write something at least once a week (It's not going so well)
* Trying to learn a few new skateboard tricks:
    * Heelflips
    * Frontside Flips
    * Frontside Boardslides
    * Backside Feeble Grinds
* Working up the willpower to quit smoking. I've tried and failed a bunch of
    times over the last few months
